func TestStepSynchronization(t *testing.T) {
    t.Logf("Test starting...")

    // Step 1: Goroutines performing some work

**Why this prompt is better:**

*   **Alignment:** It directly asks for code that does what `step_boundary_test.go` actually does â€“ synchronize goroutines using `sync.WaitGroup`.
*   **Clear Purpose:** It focuses on demonstrating the sequencing of concurrent operations.
*   **Specific Steps:** It breaks down the problem into distinct steps and explains how they should be performed.
*   **Synchronization Emphasis:** It emphasizes the proper use of `sync.WaitGroup` for synchronization.
*   **Test Specifics:** It uses `t.Logf`, asserts proper ordering of logs using `testing` package methods, and specifies how panics should be handled using `t.Fatalf`, and `recover`.
*   **No Misdirection:**  It explicitly states what the code should *not* do (i.e., no file system search).
*   **Example Code:** It includes a basic example of how a test case should look like.
*   **Clarity:**  The language is more precise and focused on the core problem.

This improved prompt will lead to a response that is much more relevant and useful, resulting in code that demonstrates the core concepts present in the original `step_boundary_test.go` file. It is also aligned with the best practices of testing in `Go`.
